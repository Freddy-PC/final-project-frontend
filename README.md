**Project Purpose**

Pokemon is a franchise that depicts fictional creatures that a trainer can catch & train.

Playing Pokemon games is a lot of fun and as a competitive person I always wanted to create the strongest team.
But to be the best 'that no one ever was' you need extensive knowledge on Pokemon.
The deciding factor between winning or losing against another trainer could be knowing the Pokemons Type, Ability, Stats, etc.

The Poke-Inspector app displays information about any known Pokemon. All you need to do is type a Pokemon's name or ID number, from the National Dex, and click the 'Search' button! The name, type, and image will display upon a successful search. If the Pokemon name is typed incorrectly it will not display.

If a user clicks the 'Card' displayed from the search you will see more data: the Pokemon's Ability, Hidden-Ability, Weight, Height, and stats.
Any trainer can view the application as it dynamically adapts to different screen sizes.
